# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This project is a proof of concept showcasing creativity and functionality. While it's still a bit rough around the edges, it serves as a testament to what can be achieved with a bit of free time. Below, you'll find an overview of how it all works.

## How It All Works!

### Frontend: Vue 3 and Vite

The frontend is built using Vue 3, a progressive JavaScript framework that allows for building user interfaces in a modular way. Here’s how it’s structured and some of the benefits of using Vue:

- **Components**: The website is composed of several Vue components, each responsible for a specific part of the interface. For example, the `TopBanner.vue` handles the top banner section, which contains our bubble links components. Other components include the `Body.vue`, which is used for displaying blog posts and eventually other content.
- **Single-File Components**: Vue's single-file components (SFCs) allow us to encapsulate the template, script, and style in a single file, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Reactive Data**: Vue 3's reactivity system ensures that the UI automatically updates when the underlying data changes, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Vite**: The development process is streamlined using Vite, a next-generation front-end tooling that offers fast cold starts and instant hot module replacement (HMR). Vite serves and bundles the files efficiently, making development quick and easy.

### Backend: Express.js

The backend is powered by Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Here’s a closer look:

- **Server Setup**: The server is set up in the `personal-website-express` directory. It serves the static files generated by the Vue build process and handles any server-side logic required.
- **API Endpoints**: Express.js allows us to create RESTful API endpoints to handle data fetching, user authentication, and other server-side operations. These endpoints are defined in various route files within the server directory. While the current personal website does not make use of these features, it leaves room to expand the server to handle more complex functionalities.
- **Middleware**: We use middleware in Express to handle tasks such as parsing JSON bodies, managing sessions, and logging requests. Middleware functions can be added in the server setup to process requests before they reach the route handlers. This is used more extensively in servers requiring database routing or authentication stages. Eventually, the Rummage project will be given a blog post which takes advantage of these and API Endpoint features more robustly.
- **Deployment**: The deployment process involves building the Vue project and copying the generated `dist` folder to the Express server's `public` directory. This way, the server can serve the static files efficiently. The server can then be started using `npm start` to serve the application to users.

### Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/sullivan-lconnor/personal-website.git cd personal-website`
    
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    
    `npm install`
    
3. **Start Development Server**:
    
    `npm run dev`
    
4. **Build for Production**:

    `npm run build`
    
5. **Serve the Production Build**:
        
    `cd personal-website-express cp -r ../dist/ ./dist npm start`
